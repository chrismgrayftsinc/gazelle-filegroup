# gazelle-filegroup

This is a fork of sluongng/ugazelle with only one purpose -- to
provide a gazelle plugin that creates a `filegroup` for every source
file found in a bazel package. These are mostly useful to me when
using Zetten/bazel-sonarqube, but there may be other compelling
reasons to use them.
