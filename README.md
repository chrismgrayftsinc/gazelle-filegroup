# gazelle-filegroup

This is a fork of [ugazelle](sluongng/ugazelle) with only one purpose -- to
provide a gazelle plugin that creates a `filegroup` for every source
file found in a bazel package. These are mostly useful to me when
using [bazel-sonarqube](Zetten/bazel-sonarqube), but there may be other compelling
reasons to use them.
