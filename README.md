# gazelle-filegroup

This is a fork of [ugazelle](https://github.com/sluongng/ugazelle)
with only one purpose -- to provide a gazelle plugin that creates a
`filegroup` for every source file found in a bazel package. These are
mostly useful to me when using
[bazel-sonarqube](https://github.com/Zetten/bazel-sonarqube), but
there may be other compelling reasons to use them.
